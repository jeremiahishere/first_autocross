# Preparation before the event

## Car
- Make sure the car is in good condition and not dripping any fluids
- Remove all loose items inside the car.  You can do this at the event if convenient.
  - floor mats
  - toll pass
  - garbage
  - sub woofer that is not bolted in
  - spare tire (optional)
- Make sure your battery is tied down.  Most modern cars come with a battery tie down.  You should be able to give your battery a solid tug and it should not move
- At least a quarter tank of gas

## Car Classing
On your first three events, sign up for the Novice Street Tire class (NS). Pick a number that is
easy to write with tape.  For example 1, 17, or 4.  In a two driver car, pick a three digit number
with 1 as the first digit.  That way, you can switch numbers by moving two pieces of tape.

After your first few events, you will move out of the novice classes and into the regular classes.
Here is a rough idea of how the classes work.

- Street: Almost completely stock car on stock sized wheels.  Any 200 treadwear tires allowed.
- Street Touring: Coilovers, headers, intake, replacement seats, and ECU tunes allowed.  Any 200 treadwear tires allowed.
- Street Prepared: Essentially street touring fenders can be cut to fit wider tires and R-compound slick tires allowed (Hoosiers)
- Street Modified: All Street Touring and Prepared changes allowed.  Nearly unlimited engine work allowed including adding forced induction and certain engine swaps.  Body kits and wings allowed.
- Classic American Muscle (CAM): Essentially street modified on 200TW tires except you must drive an American car.  Casual racism is encouraged.
- Prepared and Modified: Dedicated autocross cars that cannot do anything else.  They often have gutted interiors, no windshields.  Some cars are scratch built and others are retired road racers.

Each class has several sub classes so that brand new Corvettes are not competing directly against 25 year old Miatas.  Generally, there is a class at each prep level for the following categories
- High powered sports cars: Corvettes, Porsche 911, Lotus Elise, supercars
- Medium powered sports cars: Honda S2000, Newer Miatas, Nissan 350z/370Z, Porsche Boxster
- Low powered sports cars: Older Miatas
- Cars with back seats: BMW 3 series, Subaru BRZ/Toyota 86, Ford Focus ST, Honda Civic Si, Mini Cooper S, Mazda RX8
- Muscle cars: Mustang, Camaro, etc
- Rally cars: Subaru STI, Mitsubishi Evo, Ford Focus RS

## Tools
You will be able to borrow all of these at your first event.  I carry my own for convenience.

- Tire pressure gauge with [an air bleed button](https://www.amazon.com/Joes-Racing-32307-Pressure-Gauge/dp/B00404WDUC)
- Torque wrench and socket for lug nuts
- Air pump
- Masking tape to make numbers for your car.  Try to get a color that contrasts with your car's color.

## For yourself
- Do not wear red clothes or bring a red umbrella.  You will be required to cover them up while working the course.
- Registration cash or check unless paying online
- Sunscreen
- Bug spray
- Umbrella or rain coat
- Water, at least a gallon per person
- Lunch, there will not be time to leave the venue to pick up food
- Closed toe shoes appropriate for walking several miles
- Snell/SA rated helmet with a rating less than 10 years old
  - In 2017, legal helmets are the 2015 and 2010 rated helmets
  - Motorcycle helmets are likely not legal but you can give it a try
  - Open faced and closed faced helmets are legal
  - If you don't have a helmet, you can borrow a helmet at the venue.  They will be stinky so buy a headsock or balaclava.  These are available on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/K1-Race-Gear-701430-Cotton/dp/B0041QZQP8) and most motorcycle stores.

# Preparation at the event

## Schedule
The schedules changes from event to event but this one is roughly correct for most events.  Plan on
getting there around 8:00am.

- 7:30am          Gates open
- 8:00am-8:45am   Onsite Registration/Check-in (you have to check in even if you registered online)
- 8:00am-8:45am   Tech Inspection
- 8:30am-9:15am   Course Open for walking
- 9:00am-9:15am   Novice Walk-through
- 9:30am-9:45am   Driverâ€™s Meeting (course closed for walking)
- 10:00am-4:00pm  Competition

## Car
- Inflate tires to 40 psi if running all season or summer tires
- Put on numbers and class using masking tape
- Check that lug nuts are tight
- Check in at the trailer
- Go through tech inspection

## For Yourself
- Check in at the trailer
- Go through tech inspection
- Walk the course.  I normally do this 2 or 3 times at an event.
- Go on the novice walkthrough.  This is another course walk with an experienced driver to help you navigate the course.
- Learn the run order at the driver's meeting
  - You will be driving in one heat, working in one heat, and resting in one heat

## Walking the course
- After checking in and going through tech, walk the course several times.  If possible, find a course map.  Otherwise, find someone who looks like they know what they are doing and discretely follow them around the course.
- Remember that you will be sitting on the left side of the car.  Walk close to cones on the left and about 6 feet away from cones on the right.
- When you enter a corner, look forward to see where the corner ends to plan where you are going to walk.
- Identify confusing course elements and go through them a second time
- Determine which way to go around optional slaloms.  Do you want to start on the left or right of the first cone?  Where do you want the car to be at the end of the slalom?
- Note where the timing stops at the finish.  You will want to be at full throttle all the way through the timing lights.
- Make sure to report to the novice walkthrough.  It will include a course walkthrough and how to safely work on the course.

# Running the course

## Driving

- If the course workers wave a red flag at you, come to a completed stop.  The workers will let you know when it is safe to proceed.  Someone probably spun out in front of you.  You will get a rerun.
- If you see a course worker running in front of your car, do not run them over.  You will get a rerun.
- If you start to spin the car, do not try and save it.  Press the clutch and brake pedals until you come to a full stop.  This makes your car go in a predictable direction so corner workers can get out of the way.

## Your first run
- Line up your car in the paddock.  After each run, you will want to return to the same space.  The front few slots are reserved for two driver cars.
- A worker will be directing cars in the paddock to get in line to run.  Start your car when he is a few cars away from you.
- Turn off traction control
- When the grid worker gets to you, let him know you want an instructor.  He will call for one on the radio.
- Pick up your instructor and slowly drive up to the start line.  When you are 2nd in line, give some room to the first guy.  Rear wheel drive cars can kick up rocks when they start.
- Once it is your turn, inch up to the line and watch for the starting worker.  They will let you know when your car is in the correct position.  Be ready to brake.
- When the starting worker waves the flag, you can start your run.  The launch is not timed so don't worry about going exactly when the flag drops.  Timing starts about 10 or 12 feet after the start line so you don't need to dump the clutch.
- Shift into 2nd gear at the first corner no matter what speed you are going.  Stay in 2nd gear with both hands on the wheel for the rest of your run.
- Focus on staying on course instead of going fast.  Once you have a valid time, you can start speeding up.
- After your first or second run, have the instructor drive the car with you in the passenger seat.

## Course Elements

- Gate
  - Go between the cones
  - ![gate](https://wrpca.wildapricot.org/resources/Pictures/Car%20Control%20Clinic/cone-gate.png)
- Single cone with pointer
  - Go on the side opposite the pointer
  - ![pointer](http://www.d3f.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG_0336-e1283219599433.jpg)
  - ![pointer2](https://wrpca.wildapricot.org/resources/Pictures/Car%20Control%20Clinic/cone-pointer.png)
- Multiple pointer cones
  - Look in the direction the cones are pointing for the next element
  - If you hit these, there is no penalty but you will likely miss the next element
  - ![pointer wall](http://racingready.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pano-1e1.jpg)
- Slalom
  - Alternate sides
  - If the first cone has a pointer, there is only one way to go through
  - If the first cone doesn't have a pointer, you can start on the left side or the right side ![non-optional slalom](http://www.geocities.ws/MotorCity/Downs/3837/autoxfu5.gif) ![slalom2](http://cdn.ggcbmwcca.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Autox04.jpg) ![slalom 3](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--GZJq3Zy2--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/19dz0zeptyjx3jpg.jpg)
- Sweepers
  - Often only include an entry cone and an exit cone.  You are on your own for finding a good path between them
  ![sweeper](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QBZwUXdYHEM/U6DtSVpJ0bI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/vXvMdskzxoo/s1600/DSCN6359.JPG)

## Working the course
- Don't get hit by a car.  If a cone is knocked down and you cannot pick it up in time for the next car, they can either ignore it or stop and honk their horn.  If they stop, then they get a rerun.  If they don't stop, make sure the right car gets the cone penalty
- Don't take the radio and flag as a novice.  You will probably be a runner for cones on your first few events.

### Cone penalties
  - When a cone gets knocked down, put it back in the correct place and let the radio guy know that the car should be penalized
  - Each cone should have a box drawn around the base in white chalk
    - Knocking a standing cone over is a two second penalty
    - Hitting a standing cone so that it is still upright out of the box is a two second penalty
    - Nudging a standing cone so that it is still upright but still in the box is no penalty.  When this happens, recenter the cone in the box and let the radio guy know there is no penalty.  It is often hard to see if a cone is in or out from the worker station
    - Hitting a lying down pointer cone is no penalty but you normally have to hit an upright cone to get to the pointer.  Hitting a standing cone and a pointer together, counts as 1 cone penalty cone even though you have to replace two cones.

### DNF penalties
  - If a driver misses a gate, it counts as a DNF for the run
  - If the driver hits an upright cone, they are almost certainly on course
  - dnfs are normally caused by:
    - going on the outside of a gate ![outside](http://www.sccahawaii.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gates-01-1024x663.png)
    - going the wrong way around a pointer ![outside 2](http://www.sccahawaii.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DNF-01.png)
    - not alternating sides on a slalom ![outside 3](http://www.torcavettes.com/wp-content/uploads/autocross/TORCA_DNF.jpg)
    - starting a slalom on the wrong side
